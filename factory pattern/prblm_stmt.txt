Problem Statement

Create a notification system that can send different types of notifications based on specific events. For 
example, send an email notification when a user registers for an account, or a push notification when an 
order is shipped.

Requirements:
-> Define an interface for notifications.
-> Implement concrete types for each type of notification, such as EmailNotification and PushNotification.
-> Create a factory that can create the appropriate notification type based on the event type.
