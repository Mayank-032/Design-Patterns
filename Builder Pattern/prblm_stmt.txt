Problem Statement:

Let's say you are building a system for creating custom sandwiches, and you want to implement a builder 
pattern for the Sandwich struct. The Sandwich can have various components like bread type, fillings, 
condiments, and vegetables. Create a builder pattern for the Sandwich struct, and then evaluate your 
implementation for correctness and provide a correct answer if needed.


How I will proceed further
1.) Create a Sandwich struct which will contain properties like
    -> Type of Bread (BreadType string)
    -> Fillings (Fillings []string)
    -> Vegetables (Vegetables []string)
    -> Extras (Extras []string)

2.) My Sandwich builder will be used to get or set the values of this object and its build function will 
    set the values of the object and return my object.
